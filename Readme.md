With this port scanner, I just attempt to connect<sup>This is a form of "reconnaissance" for hackers and penetration testers</sup> at various ports, and do nothing else. If I'm able to connect to open ports, then I know at least the port is open.

## Pre-requisites :rotating_light:

[![node-current](https://img.shields.io/node/v/express?logo=node.js)](https://nodejs.org/) [![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/vinitshahdeo/PortScanner?logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org/)

- **Python** `>= v2.7.0`
    - Install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/).

- **Node.js** `>= v0.10.0`
    - Install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
    
- **Pip** `>= v9.0.1`
    - Install pip from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

## How to run? :rocket:

### To run Port Scanner: (Via Terminal)

- **Open terminal** and **type `npm install`**: This will install the dependencies ([Express](https://expressjs.com)).

- In the same terminal and **type `npm start`**: This will start multiple servers within the given range.

- **Open another terminal** and **type `python src/scanner.py`**: Enter `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. It will scan all the ports and print the open ports.

> Note: You can enter remote host if you want to scan the ports for any remote host. Check the [DISCLAIMER.md](./DISCLAIMER.md) before doing this.

### To run Port Scanner: (Via UI)

#### Install [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#install-flask)

> *Make sure you have `Python27\Scripts` path added to your system's environment variables.*

**1**. In PowerShell,

```ps 
pip install flask
```

#### Install virtual environment 

> *This step is required only if you are using Python2.7, skip this step when running Python3.X.*

**2**. For Python 2, (via pip)

   In PowerShell,

```ps
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv --help
```

> *Kindly [check this](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) if pip installation fails.*

#### Create virtual environment

**3**. Create a `venv` folder inside `src`,

```ps
python -m virtualenv venv
\Python27\Scripts\virtualenv.exe venv
```

#### Activate the virtual environment

**4**. Activate `venv`,

```ps
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**5**. Run `mainScanner.py`,

```ps
pip install flask
python src/mainScanner.py
```
**6**. Go to the port url returned by your terminal.

### To run IP Scanner:

- **Open terminal** and **type `python src/ipscanner.py`**: Enter any IP address `XXX.XXX.XXX.YYY`. It will scan all the addresses in the range `XXX.XXX.XXX.0` to `XXX.XXX.XXX.255` and print the addresses which are live.

## Configuration :gear:

The servers are opened at multiple ports, you can change the low range and high range for the ports to be listened by the Express server.

```js
{
    "range": {
        "low": "1",
        "high": "8888"
    },
    "ipRange": {
        "low": "0",
        "high": "255"
    },
    "count": "10",
    "thread": { 
        "count": 8
    }
}
```

- `range.low`: _lowest port number (**inclusive**)_
- `range.high`: _highest port number (**exclusive**)_
- `ipRange.low`: _lowest IP address range (**inclusive**)_
- `ipRange.high`: _highest IP address range (**inclusive**)_
- `count`: _total number of ports_
- `thread.count`: _total number of concurrent threads_

## Need for Multithreading :white_check_mark:

>The ability of a process to execute multiple threads parallelly is called multithreading. Ideally, multithreading can significantly improve the performance of any program.

Imagine scanning substantial number of ports(`range.high` = 8888) consecutively. The process would require quite a long time. 

This calls for the need of concurrency in different parts of this range(1-8888). That is, running different parts(1-1111, 1112-2222, 2223-3333...) of the same process at the same time. This would reduce the time required for completion by significant amount. The reduction in time can be related to the number of concurrent ranges(threads) being scanned simultaneously. Checkout the `Performance Analysis` for a follow up.

## Performance using threads :dart:

- `src/single/scanner.py`: Scanner without thread
- `src/scanner.py`: Scanner with multi threads

|Range(low-high)|`src/single/scanner.py` (in milliseconds)    |`src/scanner.py` (in milliseconds)   |
|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|1-80           |143243                            |30862                                   |

> `CONST_NUM_THREADS` : 8

### Performance on the basis of number of threads :chart_with_downwards_trend:

Range of ports: `1-80`

|Number of threads|Execution time (in milliseconds)   | Compared Performances|

|2                |71627                              |50 % faster           |
|4                |40808                              |71.51 % faster        |

|16               |36870                              |74.26 % faster        |
|32               |32674                              |77.19 % faster        |
